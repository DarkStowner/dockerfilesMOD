This repo is freely inspired from the awesome jfrazelle [repo](https://github.com/jfrazelle/dockerfiles).

This is a repo to hold various Dockerfiles for images I create.

Almost all of these live on [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/pbertera/)
You may also want to checkout my dotfiles, specifically the aliases for all these files which are [here](https://github.com/pbertera/dotfiles/blob/master/.dockerfunc).
